# neofsn

> **Status: beta.** neofsn is under active development. Expect rough edges, changing behavior, and the occasional bug.
>
> **Requires macOS 15 (Sequoia) or later.**

A spatial filesystem navigator for macOS — a modern homage to SGI's **FSN** (the "File System Navigator" famously shown as the 3D UNIX interface in *Jurassic Park*). Folders become blue platforms, files become flat slabs you fly through, and a warm pulsing halo marks whatever you've selected. Built with SwiftUI for the shell and SceneKit for the 3D scene.

> *"It's a UNIX system. I know this."*

## Features

- **3D folder visualization.** Each folder is a plate; its files are flat slabs and its subfolders are raised macOS-blue platforms carrying their own contents.
- **Fly camera.** WASD / arrow keys to move, `Q`/`E` to change altitude, drag to look, scroll to dolly. Hold `Shift` to move faster.
- **Configurable coloring** — toggle between **age heat-map** (FSN-style: red this week → through orange, yellow, green, teal, blue → purple for >1 year) and **file-type palette** (categorical: code, images, audio, video, docs, archives, config, …). Switch live from the top bar; the scene recolors in place without a rescan.
- **File-type icons** stamped on each slab using a shared `FileKind` taxonomy that drives both the icon and the type-mode color.
- **Layered descent.** Stepping into a subfolder drops a new plate beside-and-below the current one and pans the camera to it — the parent stays on screen, so you keep your bearings instead of losing context to a full redraw.
- **Hierarchical sidebar** mirroring the tree, with two-way sync: pick something in 3D and the sidebar scrolls to it; click in the sidebar and the camera flies to it.
- **Interactive breadcrumb bar** — jump to any ancestor folder with a click.
- **Selection halo.** The selected item gets a soft warm-gold ring of light around its base, gently pulsing — the app's signature visual.
- **Remembers your last folder.** The opened folder is persisted as a security-scoped bookmark and reopened automatically on the next launch.
- **Expanded metadata HUD** with kind chip, name, full path, size (or file/subdir count for folders), modified/created dates, permissions (`rwx`), and age — plus an inline action strip: Quick Look, Open, Copy Path (`⇧⌘C`), Reveal in Finder, and Descend (for folders).
- **Finder integration & Quick Look** — open in the default app (`⇧⌘O`), reveal in Finder (`⌘R`), copy path (`⇧⌘C`), or press `Space` to Quick Look the selection.
- **Reset view** (`⌘0`, the scope button, or click empty space) re-frames the current folder.

## Requirements

- macOS 15.0 (Sequoia) or later — this is the app's minimum deployment target
- Xcode 26 or later to build. The `.xcodeproj` is committed, so you can open it directly. [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) is only needed if you change `project.yml`.

## Building

Open `neofsn.xcodeproj` in Xcode and build, or from the command line:

```sh
xcodebuild -project neofsn.xcodeproj -scheme neofsn -configuration Debug build
```

`project.yml` is the source of truth for the project structure. The generated `neofsn.xcodeproj` is committed so a fresh checkout opens without extra setup. If you edit `project.yml`, run `xcodegen generate` (`brew install xcodegen` first) and commit the regenerated project alongside it.

## Testing

Unit tests for the model layer live in `neofsnTests/` (Swift Testing). Run them with:

```sh
xcodebuild -project neofsn.xcodeproj -scheme neofsn -destination 'platform=macOS' test
```

## Running

The easiest way is to open `neofsn.xcodeproj` in Xcode and press **Run** (`⌘R`).

To launch a command-line build directly, open the product Xcode just built:

```sh
open "$(xcodebuild -project neofsn.xcodeproj -scheme neofsn -configuration Debug \
  -showBuildSettings 2>/dev/null | awk '/ BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR /{d=$3} END{print d}')/neofsn.app"
```

On first launch the 3D view is empty. Click **Open…** (or press `⌘O`) and choose a folder to visualize. The app is sandboxed and uses security-scoped bookmarks, so it only ever reads the folders you explicitly pick — and it remembers the last one, reopening it automatically on the next launch. Once a folder is open, fly around with the keyboard and mouse (see below), click items to inspect them, and step into subfolders to descend.

## Keyboard & mouse

| Action | Binding |
| --- | --- |
| Move / strafe | `W` `A` `S` `D` or arrow keys |
| Altitude | `E` (up) / `Q` (down) |
| Speed boost | hold `Shift` |
| Look around | left- or right-drag |
| Dolly | scroll |
| Select / enter | single-click |
| Open file / re-root folder | double-click |
| Quick Look | `Space` |
| Open in default app | `⇧⌘O` |
| Reveal in Finder | `⌘R` |
| Copy path | `⇧⌘C` |
| Open folder… | `⌘O` |
| Back | `⌘[` |
| Reset view | `⌘0` |

## Tooling notes

The project structure is defined in `project.yml` and generated via XcodeGen; the resulting `.xcodeproj` is committed. For editors that use `sourcekit-lsp`, run `scripts/gen-compile-commands.sh` to generate a `compile_commands.json` so cross-file symbols resolve. The build itself always goes through `xcodebuild` / Xcode.
